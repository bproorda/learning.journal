**Computer Architecture**

-   *What is a computer:* The core of what makes a computer a computer is that
    it is a machine, a tool. Throughout history tools and machines and been made
    to augment or take the place of our physical abilities. Computers do the
    same, but for our mental abilities. Mathematical models and approximations
    that used to have be done by hand and could entire large books for one
    single equation, can now be modeled by simple computer program.

    -   The four steps at how a computer works is that receives **input** from a
        user, it **stores** that information, it **processes** the information
        toward some desired result, and then it **outputs** that result back to
        user.

-   *Binary and Data:* Buried beneath layers of programming languages, the
    language of a computer is 1’s and 0’s. This binary system relies on a flow
    of electricity or lack thereof to create the two values. The more of these
    we have, the more complex things we can represent with these two numbers.

    -   The binary system utilizes those ones and zeros to calculate *any*
        number. The first digit is multiplied by 1, the next by 2, the next by
        4, the fourth by 8 and so forth. All of these numbers are then added
        together to get the desired number. If you had 32 digits of binary, i.e.
        32 wires, you could represent numbers over 4 billion!

    -   Letters are represented as numbers which are then represented by binary
        numbers.

    -   Images/videos are broken down into pixels which are represented by
        numbers.

-   *Circuits and Logic:* Circuits take in and modify the electrical signal
    depending on their structure, performing very simple calculations. Different
    circuits, called logic gates, are labeled from operators such as not, and,
    or. Combining these together allow from more complicated calculations, such
    as arithmetic. As you combine more and more of these together, the
    calculations can build up everything you see on the screen right now.

-   *CPU, Memory, Input, Output:* All of the various kinds of input devices, is
    eventually converting the input to numbers then into binary. It is stored in
    memory/ram. The CPU is where the processing, the calculating, takes place.
    Then it sent back to memory before being sent to the output device first as
    binary, then numbers, and finally as the desired output. The more
    calculations that are needed, the more memory and processing power you
    require.

-   *Hardware and Software:* The physical components of the computer is the
    hardware. The information and instructions and carried and used by the
    hardware is the software. The software sends commands to CPU which tells it
    which of its individual circuits it needs to perform the required
    calculation. Managing all of the software is the Operating System, OS. It
    controls which programs are run and when they are sent to CPU, switching
    between the programs in tiny fractions of second.
