## Structuring Websites ##

**Who is the site for?** Given the possiblities of how one can make a website, a good first step to is narrow down the options to something more managable. You can do this by determing the target audience. You can set up personas, mock visitor profiles, to help identify you the site is for. Then you consider what the vistors are to achieve and what information then need to accomplish their task. When you know that, you know what the website needs.

Another possible question is how often customers will visit your site. If the site is selling a less commonly purchased good, or a long term asset, it may stay much the same for long time. If the point of the site is content, for information or entertainment, you will need to update much more frequently. 

**Site Mapping** After you have your questions answered, the next step is sort where the information needs to go. You start by creating a diagram of the pages to be used, known as a *site map.* You start with the home page and then divide up the pages as needed. Keep in mind that you want to make the site as easy to use for the visitor as possible.

**Wireframe** Once you have an idea on how to sort the pages, you turn to organizing the individual pages. A *wireframe* is a basic sketch of the key information and where it needs to go on the page. You have to prioritize the most important information, or where the visitor will need to start. This can be done by making parts of the page distinct from surrounding content and by creating a *visual hierarchy*. This means using a combination of size, color, and style, to draw the visitor's eye where you want it to go quickly.

Similar or related items should be group together and/or connected by borders or background. This will help the visitor to know that these items are related. When doing this, be sure to be consistent with the formatting. You can also have one common heading for the related elements.

**Designing Navigation** Every site will need some kind of navigation to help your visitor move around the site and give them a better idea of what they will find. The three big principles in making navigation is to make sure it is concise, clear, and selective. It shoud provide context, be interactive, and be consistent across the different pages.
