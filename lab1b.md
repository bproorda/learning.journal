## What is a Growth Mindset? ##

  The best way to understand a _growth mindset_ is to start with its opposite, the _fixed mindset_. This is the more predominant belief, for now anyway. It is a kind of genetic fatalism, you are what you got. Your intelligence, physical abilities, creativity, are all determined by your genes and maybe your environment as a child. Even if they do include the enivornment as being a factor, after you reach adulthood, you are fixed. Your life and brain are carved into stone and unchangable.
  
  The _growth mindset_ is the opposite. You are not fixed, but every day is a new starting point. Modern neuroscience has discovered that brain is constantly changing and rewiring itself. In other words, if you wish to learn something, an instrument, calculus, coding, etc. All you need to do is perserve and you neurons will reshape themselves to accommadate you. 
  
## Tips for finding and maintaining a Growth Mindset ##

  As a growth mindset is very different from how we normally approach things, it can be difficult use and keep. Below are some thoughts to help keep me (and you) in the right mindset.
  1. ** Go towards your challenges **
         - When you are in the _fixed mindset_ and you run in a wall, you stop and turn around, believing that is impossible to get                  past that wall. You _avoid_ the problem, which is very easy to do and do often. You can end up like a rat in a maze,                    getting nowhere, frustrated and depressed.
           - For the _Growth Mindset_ when you see a problem, like a wall, you don't turn around and walk away. You approach it. You                    embrace the challenge and look for the solution.
  2. ** Perserverance **
         - When you are in the _fixed mindset_ effort often feels pointless. After a failure, effort can even seem painful. If you are                not good at something, then you will never be good at it. Why then would you ever try? Besides there are far easier and                  more enjoyable things you could be doing, right?          
           - Someone in the _growth mindset_ understand that things can change, including themselves. The key to doing so is putting in                the  displined effort. It will not be fast, easy, or fun; but with enough of the right effort, you can change. As it says                in the quote above, try one more time.
  3. ** How to accept criticism **
         - Criticism can be very hard to deal with, especially when you are in the fixed mindset. It is far too easy to take criticism             you recieved for something you did, such as a woodworking project. and turn it in criticism about _you._  Then you start to             believe that you simply are not any good at woodworking and never trying it again.
           - In the _growth mindset_, criticism is a lot more like troubleshooting. It is feedback that lets you know that something                 isn't quite right. The trick is, to accept that feedback as an opportunity to learn. The more you screw up, the more you                 can learn, and the better you will be!
