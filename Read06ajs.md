# Introducing Javascript #

- **What is it**
   - programming language developed to make webpages interactive.
   - it is the behavior layer, where the html is content and css is presentation.
   -written in plain text, does not require complier
    -an interperted language, works and runs entirely in the browser.

- **Linking js to html
    - best way is to have js in a separate file and link it
      > ```<script src="js/add-content.js"></script>```
    - you can also put it directly into the page, like css
      > ```<script></script>```
    - when the browser finds a ```<script>``` element, it will stop and see if it needs to do anything.

- **Objects and Methods**
    - example of _calling_ a method
       >```object.method(parameters);```
       >```document.write('Good Afternoon');```
