**Hi!** My name is Brennan Roorda. I have lived several places across the Midwest and some places further when I was young. Iowa seems to be my place now. If I am not working, I am usually reading, playing with my nephew, or running through the woods. My OS version is Windows 10 Home 1903. I am looking forward to learning new skills, and hopefully making a new start!
