**Programming with JavaScript**

-   *What can JavaScript do?*

    -   **Access** the content of the page

    -   **Modify** the content of the page

    -   **Program** rules or instructions the browser can follow

    -   **React** to events triggered by the user or browser

-   *The ABC’s of Programming*

    -   A: What is a script and how do I make one?

        -   A script is a series of instructions a computer can follow to
            achieve a desired result.

        -   To write a script: start with the goal, find the tasks necessary to
            accomplish the goal, then the steps needed to do each task.

        -   Using a flow chart can be very helpful

**Expressions and Operators**

-   *Expressions*

    -   An expressions results in a single value. There two kinds:

        -   Expressions that assign a value to a variable, “var a = 5”

        -   Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value,
            “var b = ```5\*2”```

-   *Operators*

    -   Expressions use operators to work

    -   Assignment operator: =

    -   Arithmetic operator: +, -, ```\*```, %(modulus)

    -   String operator: + (concatenation)

**Functions**

-   *What is a function?*

    -   A function is a group of series of statements together to perform a
        specific task.

    -   When you need a function to run, it is called.

    -   Some functions need inputs to run, called parameters.

    -   The output of a function is called the return value.

-   *Declaring a function*

    -   Function.fuction-name() {code block}

-   *Calling a function*

    -   Function(arguments as needed)
